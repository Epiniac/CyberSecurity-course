Welcome to my personal journey through the **90 Days of Cybersecurity** challenge! This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my progress, notes, resources, and hands-on exercises as I build a strong foundation in cybersecurity.

## 🚀 Goals

I'm undertaking this challenge to:

- **Build a solid foundation** in cybersecurity principles and practices
- **Gain hands-on experience** with essential tools like Linux, Python, Wireshark, ELK stack, and cloud platforms
- **Prepare for certifications** such as Network+ and Security+
- **Develop daily learning habits** to foster continuous growth
- **Document progress** for personal reflection and to help others on similar paths

## 📅 Daily Breakdown

Here's the structured roadmap for the 90 days:

| Days | Focus Area | Key Topics |
|------|------------|------------|
| 1-7 | Network+ Concepts | Networking fundamentals, OSI model, TCP/IP, subnetting |
| 8-14 | Security+ Concepts | Security principles, threats, cryptography, risk management |
| 15-28 | Linux Tutorials | Command line, file systems, permissions, scripting |
| 29-42 | Python | Programming basics, automation scripts, security tools |
| 43-56 | Traffic Analysis | Wireshark, packet analysis, network forensics |
| 57-63 | Git | Version control, collaboration, GitHub workflows |
| 64-70 | ELK Stack | Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana for log analysis |
| 71-77 | Cloud Platforms | GCP, AWS, or Azure security configurations |
| 78-84 | Advanced Topics | Vulnerability assessment, penetration testing basics |
| 85-90 | Ethical Hacking | Practical hacking techniques, tools, and methodologies |
| 91-92 | Resume Building | Creating a one-page cybersecurity resume |
| 93-95 | Career Guidance | Job applications, interviews, networking in cybersecurity |
